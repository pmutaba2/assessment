# Introduction
The entire challenge revolves around the general knowledge that every cyber security engineer should possess. It primarily focuses on fundamental programming abilities and message hashing for more secure communication.

# How to open and solve the challenge
To read the content of the flag file, you'll need to download it and open it with whatever text editor you like. When you open the file, you'll see a message a text message that you'll need to develop a program to reverse its original message, which you'll have to hash with md5 to retrieve the actual flag for submission.

# Conlusion
Overall, you should be comfortable with programming languages such as C++, Java, or Python, though I recommend Java.
